# macOS - Beta

Run on a macOS machine with a graphical user interface for settings - Docker is required to run the toolbox (https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

As the toolbox setup needs access to your computer's display, the toolbox must be run on a system with an X11 server installed.

With docker engine and an X11 server running, execute Run.sh in the folder you wish to run the toolbox in. This can be done through typing the following into the terminal in the correct folder. This may require administrator privileges.

```
sh Run.sh
```

The Decision Support Tool is open source and can be freely downloaded from https://github.com/ACTOMtoolbox, which also includes documentation and instructions. If used independently the developers accept no liability relating to the use of the DST. 

The toolbox developers, an academic / R&D consortium based in the UK, Norway, Netherlands and US would be delighted to discuss providing a service using the DST, please contact one or more of: 

UK: Jerry Blackford jcb@pml.ac.uk  

Norway: Guttorm Alendal Guttorm.Alendal@uib.no  

NL: Stefan Carpentier stefan.carpentier@tno.nl  

USA: Katherine Romanak, katherine.romanak@beg.utexas.edu and/or Rajesh Pawar, rajesh@lanl.gov 

We strongly encourage everyone downloading and using the DST code to register as a user by filling a short registration form. We’d love to get a better understanding of who is using the DST and for what applications, as it will help us to provide the best support to the user community and allows us to demonstrate (anonymised) use metrics to our funders. It will also allow you to receive information and news on any updates.
